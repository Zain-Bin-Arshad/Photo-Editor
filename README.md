# Photo-Editor

"**A picture worth thousand words**" 🖼️ 
In order to speak those thousand words, your picture should be perfect in every sense. You can enjoy following features in this application:

- Image resizing
- Crop
- Adjust brightness
- Rotate image
- Filter i.e grey-scale, chrome etc
- Detect text & triangles
- Check Component colors

## How to run?
Make sure you have **MS Visual Studio** installed. You can build from source code, open **PhotoEditor.sln** file and then click on `start` button. If you are not a computer geek you can simply go to this path and run the `.exe` file.

> PhotoEditor\bin\Debug\PhotoEditor.exe

## Resize, Crop and Component colors

## Edge
This feature will convert your picture into edge form, meaning only edge of the object can be seen. You can use this to detect objects or as a filter, whatever suits you best.

## Thanks

I would like to thank my teacher **Sir Mohsin Mehdi**, who taught us valuable things about computer graphics, which helped me a lot in creating this application.
